## Project Simple Shell from Holberton School Paris

Simple Shell is the the last project of the trimester, and the second collaborative project of the year. It is a simple version of the shell used by Linux.

## Description
Shell is a command interpreter: the shell technique is an infinite loop in C that reads what the user types in the promp and performs the appropriate actions. Either it's an internal shell command that's executed directly (internal functions), or it's an external program.

There are three parts to running a command:
* Read: Read the command from standard input.
* Parse: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.
* Execute: Run the parsed command.
